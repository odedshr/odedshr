## ‚öΩÔ∏è Fun stuff

For the latest projects, check out my github or blog, but here are two nice old projects:

### Agrolog - Agricultural Assistance (2012)

A mobile app for helping farmers monitor farm tasks by providing reminders, statistical analyses, knowledge sharing and social interactions.
I developed the application for the iPhone platform using Objective-C and produced an accompanying promotional website and [video](http://tinyurl.com/agrolog).

### NekudaPsik: UX in 2020 video (2009)

3 years before Google Goggles, I [suggested](http://tinyurl.com/ux2020) a goggles-and-gloves based haptic interface for a totally immersive user experience.
